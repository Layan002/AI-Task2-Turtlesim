# Install ROS1 and ROS2
Ensure you have ROS 1 installed on your system. If you haven't installed it yet, you can follow [the official ROS installation guide](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation).

# Install Turtlesim Package:
Make sure the Turtlesim package is installed. You can install it using the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-turtlesim
```
> [!NOTE]
> Replace noetic with your ROS distribution if you're using a different version (e.g., melodic, kinetic).

# Initialize ROS:
Source your ROS setup file to set up the environment:
```
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
```
